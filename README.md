## What is ZFileSync?

ZFileSync is a lightweight desktop utility that mirrors files and folders between two locations in real time. The primary use case is syncing files that live in inconvenient places — game logs, app output, config files — straight into your workspace, automatically.

It runs silently in the system tray, continues syncing after the window is closed, and keeps a full history of everything that happened.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ZFileSync syncs locally between two paths on the **same machine** (or network-mounted drives). It is **not** a cloud backup tool.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  React + TypeScript (UI)     │   IPC   │  Rust backend (Tauri)        │
│  · Pair list / add / edit    │ ◄─────► │  · SyncManager               │
│  · Activity feed             │  events │  · notify watcher            │
│  · Conflict / respawn prompts│         │  · Startup reconciler        │
│  · Settings / tray menu      │         │  · SQLite (rusqlite)         │
└──────────────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Add a pair** — pick a source path and a destination path, choose direction and ignore patterns.
2. **Reconcile** — on startup ZFileSync diffs both sides and brings them into alignment immediately.
3. **Watch** — `notify` installs a filesystem watcher. Any create, modify, or delete event is debounced (~400 ms) then applied to the other side atomically.
4. **Conflict / Respawn** — two-way conflicts pause the pair and surface a resolution prompt. Deleted files that reappear trigger a respawn prompt (with a per-path "always resume" toggle).

> [!TIP]
> The perfect use case: a game writes logs to `C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\SomeGame\game.log`. Add a one-way file pair pointing that log at your workspace folder. Open your editor — the log is right there, updating live.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, 1.77+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Linux: `libwebkit2gtk`, `libgtk-3`, `libayatana-appindicator3` (or distro equivalent)
- Windows: WebView2 (ships with Windows 11; installer available for Windows 10)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHolyOneZ/ZFileSync.git
cd ZFileSync
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev        # development (hot-reload)
pnpm tauri build      # production bundle
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux, the app bundles as `.AppImage` and `.deb`. On Windows it produces an `.msi` and NSIS `.exe` installer. Cross-compilation requires setting up the target toolchain — building natively on each platform is recommended.

## Supported pair combinations

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **File · One-way** | Single file mirrored from source → destination. Perfect for log files. |
| **File · Two-way** | Both sides stay in sync; last-write wins. |
| **Folder · One-way** | Entire directory tree mirrored source → destination. Deletions propagate. |
| **Folder · Two-way** | Full bidirectional sync with conflict detection on simultaneous edits. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Two-way sync detects conflicts by comparing content hashes (blake3) against a last-known-state snapshot. When both sides change between watcher ticks the pair is **paused** and a resolution prompt appears — you choose: keep source, keep destination, or keep both (the loser is renamed `.conflict-<timestamp>`).

---

## Conflict & respawn behaviour

**Conflict (two-way only)**

When a file is modified on both sides before the watcher can sync, ZFileSync pauses the pair and shows an inline prompt:

- **Keep source** — overwrites destination, saves a `.conflict-<ts>` copy of the original dest
- **Keep destination** — discards the source change, saves a `.conflict-<ts>` copy of the original source  
- **Keep both** — copies source into `<file>.conflict-<ts>`, leaves destination untouched

**Respawn (deleted file reappears)**

If a synced file is deleted and later recreated at the same path:

- A prompt appears asking whether to resume syncing
- Choosing **Always resume this path** adds it to the auto-resume list — no more prompts for that path
